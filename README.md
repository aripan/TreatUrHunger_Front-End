## Treat Ur Hunger Web App

A full-stack web application is built for a restaurant using the (MERN) stack.

## Functionality

1. Shows Home, About us, Menu, My Favorites and Contact us pages. An user can easily navigate through the pages (except My Favorites because of the authentication).

2. While navigating, the user can make a decision by choosing a dish from the Menu by reading the comments of other customers.

3. The user can make an online reservation (for a table) as well as send his/her Feedback.

4. Along with 1, 2, and 3, the user can make a list of his/her favorite items and store them in the database of the application. For that the user must be logged-in.

5. A new user can register his/her account as well.

6. A registered user can comment as well on dishes.

## Backend

Backend Repo can be found [HERE](https://github.com/aripan/treatUrHunger_Backend).

## Hosted Version

The latest version is deployed and hosted on Heroku. Check it out by clicking [HERE](https://treaturhunger.herokuapp.com).

## Usage

You can login using the following credentials:

- Username: testUser
- Password: password

Or you can Register a new account.

## Notes

1. The Web App uses SSL encryption through HTTPS protocol to transfer input data.

2. Passwords are hashed once received by the backend.

3. Despite 1 and 2, I'd still recommend using a fake/weak password to avoid any potential future attacks.

## Last but not least

- Sometimes the server responds slow for login/register requests, so please be patient.

- However, do check your browser console for any potential bad requests or errors.

- Raise an issue in case you find any.
